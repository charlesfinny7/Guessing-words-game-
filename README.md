# Guessing-words-game
The Word Guessing Game, developed in Java, is an engaging console-based application that challenges players to uncover a hidden word by guessing letters one at a time. At the start of the game, a random word is selected from a predefined list, and players must guess the letters to reveal the word gradually. The game provides real-time feedback on the player's guesses, showing the current state of the word and tracking incorrect guesses. Players are allowed a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends, adding a layer of challenge. The user-friendly console interface makes it easy to navigate, while the inclusion of error handling ensures a smooth gameplay experience. With its object-oriented design and core Java principles, this game not only demonstrates effective use of basic programming concepts but also offers replayability and fun, making it an excellent example of interactive Java programming.
